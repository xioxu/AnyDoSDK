# AnyDoSDK
===========================================

This is a Unofficial any.do .net SDK, based on official web site http request.

In my opnion, I think there is no better Android task application than Any.do, but curruentlly there is no official SDK.

But one good news is both their web and chrome extention use same remote restfull api, so I opened the http traffic capture tool 'Fiddller' and do some operations in any.do website, then things have been make a lot easier, I wrapped the http request with .net and prvovided it to you.
